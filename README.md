# Neural-Networks-for-Dynamical-Systems

A lot of times, dynamic systems are very difficult to predict. The butterfly effect, the underlying principle of chaos theory, has established that a small disturbance in the system can lead to very different state in the future, thus making the prediction very difficult. However, there should be an underlying system describing such chaotic behavior.
